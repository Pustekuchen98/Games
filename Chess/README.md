Chess
=====

Chess game written in Ruby. Challenges overcome:
- Complex move logics for different chess pieces
- Raising & handling errors
- Deep duping a complex object
- Implement checkmate (check if a player is in check and whether any of the player's pieces has valid moves)
- Using gem 'colorize' and keyboard input for a friendly UI interface
